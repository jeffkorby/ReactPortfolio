                    Hello, my name is Jeff Korby and it is a pleasure to have you here! I am a full stack web developer based out of Northville, MI. My previous work experience was working in the durable medical devices field. I was in multiple roles during my tenure there and gained sales, management and operations skills. I also assisted with website/CRM implementation from the other side working with the people builing the website out for my company.

                    Some of my hobbies include golfing, board games, video games, books/audiobooks, and coding. I like spending time with my family, friends and of course my dog Chase! Chase is a German Shepard who is very lovable and loves to cuddle. My favorite authors are JRR Tolkien who is best known for The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. And also there is a current author named Brandon Sanderson who wrote books such as Mistborn and the Stormlight Archives. My favorite board game is called Dominion and some video games I currently like are called Smite by HiRez studios and Hades by Supergiant Games.
